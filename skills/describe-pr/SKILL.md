name: describe-pr
description: Write or rewrite a pull request description and title — concise and high-signal, tickets named up top, operational notes surfaced, a how-to-review block handing the reviewer a reading order, a mermaid diagram only when it shows what prose can't. Use whenever a PR body is being drafted or edited, including `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit`, "open a PR", "write the PR description", "update the PR body". Not for reviewing someone else's PR.

# /describe-pr — say only what the diff can't

Two people read a PR body: a reviewer deciding where to look, and whoever deploys it deciding what to do by hand. Write for those two and nobody else. **The diff already lists the files, the functions and the tests; the tickets already hold the backstory. Your only job is what neither of them shows.** **Length tracks decisions, not files** — the more mechanical the diff, the *shorter* the body. Most PRs make two or three decisions worth a paragraph; reach eight and most are one decision seen from eight files. The reading path is navigation, not prose — it sits outside this, under rules of its own.

Read the real diff (`gh pr diff`, or `git diff <base>...HEAD`) and fetch every ticket you cite before writing a word. Never invent a ticket key, never claim tests pass unless you ran them, never describe work that isn't in the diff.

## Load concise first

Read its `SKILL.md` before drafting — `.claude/skills/concise/`, `~/.claude/skills/concise/`, or `~/.claude/plugins/**/skills/concise/`. Not via the Skill tool: concise sets `disable-model-invocation`, so the call is rejected. It sets the register and never adds a fact; **what goes in is this file's call, and overrides it where they disagree** — where concise grows structure with the document, a PR body inverts it: more material, fewer headings.

Not installed: write the PR anyway — a hint, never a gate — and say so once in chat, never in the body: `npx skills add abdelrahman-elkady/kady-plugins --skill concise -a claude-code`.

## What earns a paragraph

Default is nothing. **Group every candidate fact under the decision it follows from, give that decision one paragraph however many facts ride on it, and keep it only if you can name what changes because of it — a reader's next move, or what production now does.** Six files deleted for one reason are one line of six names. More members make each *shorter*, never the paragraph longer, and a member breaks out alone only by changing a **different** one. *True* and *worth knowing* are neither.

**Tickets first, unmistakable.** Key, full link, what each one *is*, the relationship when there is one, and any decision a ticket left open with which way you went: *Fixes **[ABC-1234](https://tracker.example.com/browse/ABC-1234)** (Task) and **[ABC-1240](https://tracker.example.com/browse/ABC-1240)** (Bug) — same defect, filed twice*.

**One line of why.** What the old code did wrong, in the present tense of the old code.

**Behavior, not files.** What the system does differently now, naming the calls a reviewer would otherwise question. In prose, name a file only when the name is the news: a new module, a moved boundary.

**What a human must do that merging won't do for them.** Pre- and post-merge steps, new env vars, migrations, feature flags, config and infra changes, breaking changes. A reviewer who misses one breaks prod, so **the step is never cut** — but that covers the step a human takes, not a value merging already sets by itself, and not the sentences around it.

**What the PR leaves undone.** A ticket only partly closed says so, in a closing line. Work you didn't do stays named as not done.

Anything that doesn't apply is omitted, heading and all: no `## Testing` reading "tests added", no empty screenshots section, no "N/A". Silence means none, and prose instead of a heading doesn't smuggle one back in. **The body has no `###` headings** — a heading is how three items become three sections that each fill themselves.

**Out entirely:** a file-by-file change list · a test-by-test breakdown or coverage note · line counts · restating the ticket · what a directory holds now · what git already shows, a rename or a move · a ticket you only point at, past its link and one clause · a fact the body and the reading path both carry, an operational step aside · a clause that only backs the sentence before it, unless a reader who lacks it would undo your work — *retarget once the base PR merges* needs none, *deliberately not renamed, unlike the sibling PR* needs its clause · a summary of the summary · anything a reviewer reads faster in the diff itself. A fold launders none of these — what's cut is cut, collapsed or not.

## The diagram test

Add a mermaid diagram **only if it makes a relationship visible that the prose does not** — several distinct paths converging on one outcome, a race, a state machine, an ordering that has to hold. Then delete the prose it supersedes: a diagram substitutes, it never accumulates. Can't name in one sentence the non-obvious thing it carries? Default to none.

- **Earns it:** *every route out has to exit non-zero* — arrows from the handler, from the flush timeout, and from a signal that races the flush, all landing on one exit node.
- **Decoration, omit:** a box per bullet · a linear A→B→C a sentence already states · one caller and one callee · a redrawn file list.

## The reading path

GitHub sorts the diff alphabetically, which is never the order that makes a change comprehensible. Close the body with the order that is — last, below the diagram and the open items, folded behind a heading, not the grey triangle a reviewer scrolls past.

```markdown
<details>
<summary><h2>🧭 How to review</h2></summary>

➞ **The write path** — read in order

`routes/thing.js` `create()` → `services/thing.js` `enqueue()` → the `things` insert

Every branch has to leave the row and the job agreeing.

The duplicate-key early return is the one that doesn't — it commits the row and skips the enqueue.

➞ **Who else enqueues** — both bypass the route above

- `jobs/backfill.js` — same contract, no retry; a failed enqueue is silent here.
- `cli/import.js` — same, and it runs unsupervised.

</details>
```

Write one only if you can name the file a reviewer should open **second**. When that's "any of them" — one file changed, or six independent leaves — there's no order to teach and no block. **Two paths, three at the outside**, load-bearing first, then a different angle: the failure route, the other entry points, the change walked back from its consumer. **One idea per paragraph, a blank line between every one** — the `➞` holds a path together once the blank lines have pulled it apart: everything from one marker to the next is one path.

- **Label** — `➞`, then a bold name, alone on its line. A trailing `— gloss` earns its place only by saying what shape follows: `— read in order`, `— all three point at config/crash-policy.js`.
- **Route** — files and symbols in the order they run, `→` between hops, nothing else: no clause hanging off a hop, no aside in parentheses, never line numbers, which rot on the next push. It *skips* files, and that is what makes it a route and not the change list.
- **Reason** — one paragraph per thing worth knowing, not one per path. The invariant the walk proves is one; the guard that makes it hold at the edge is another.
- **Fan-in** — sites reaching the same target for *different* reasons get a bullet each: the path, an em dash, its own reason. One reason covering all of them stays a comma list on the route line.

A spec earns a hop only at the end of a route, where it pins the invariant faster than the code states it.

**Nothing load-bearing hides behind a fold.** An operational step, an open item, a question you want answered — those stay visible, or go in an inline comment where a reviewer can reply. **Out of the block:** a checklist to tick · "look carefully at X" with no route.

Mechanics: the summary is always `<summary><h2>🧭 How to review</h2></summary>`, verbatim — HTML because `##` inside `<summary>` renders as literal `##`, and GitHub styles `summary h2` inline-block so it sits beside the triangle rather than below it · blank line after `</summary>`, or GitHub renders the inside raw · `➞` is the literal character, not an entity · every break is a blank line, never `<br>` — GitHub doubles it into `<br><br>` in a PR body.

## The title

One line, no padding: the repo's commit convention (often `type(scope): summary`), the ticket key where the repo puts it, and the change stated as behavior — `fix(ABC-1234): exit non-zero on uncaught exception`.
